\section{CONCLUSIONS}
\label{sec:conclusions}
This study successfully addresses the limitations of conventional 2D LiDAR systems in indoor autonomous robots 
by integrating LiDAR with depth camera technology. 
The innovative sensor fusion approach presented herein enhances the robot's ability to detect 
and avoid obstacles, particularly low-lying and complex structures, 
significantly improving operational safety and efficiency.

Through the development and application of novel algorithms within the ROS2 framework, 
supported by extensive simulations in Gazebo and visual evaluations in RViz2, 
this study demonstrates a marked improvement in autonomous navigation capabilities. 
The resulting system offers a comprehensive environmental model with the advantages from two different sensors. 
This enhances the autonomy and the efficiency of indoor robots, thereby advancing the field of autonomous robot navigation.

The findings of this study have significant implications for future autonomous robotic systems, 
particularly in complex indoor environments. 
It underscores the potential of integrated sensor technologies in overcoming navigation challenges and improving operational performance.
