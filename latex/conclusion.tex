\section{CONCLUSIONS}
\label{sec:conclusions}
This study successfully addresses the limitations of conventional 2D LiDAR systems in indoor autonomous robots 
by integrating LiDAR with depth camera technology. 
The innovative  approach enhances the robot's ability to detectobstacles, particularly low-lying and complex structures.

Through the development and application of novel algorithms within the ROS2 framework, 
supported by extensive simulations in Gazebo and visual evaluations in RViz2, 
this study demonstrates a marked improvement in autonomous navigation capabilities. 
The resulting system offers a comprehensive environmental model with the advantages from two different sensors. 
This enhances the autonomy and the efficiency of indoor robots, thereby advancing the field of autonomous robot navigation.
